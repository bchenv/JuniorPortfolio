        <h3>Why I want to become a Software enginnering: Ever since I was young, I've been fascinated by how technology works, especially computers and software. I want to become a software engineer because I love solving puzzles and creating things from scratch. Writing code feels like putting together the pieces of a giant, interactive puzzle. I enjoy the challenge of figuring out how to make a program work and seeing my ideas come to life on the screen. Plus, software engineering is such a powerful field; it helps build the apps and systems that make our lives easier and more fun. Iâ€™m excited about the idea of contributing to this world and possibly creating something that could help people or even change the world.</h3>
